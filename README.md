# Fraud-detect-ML-project
## How to run the project
In the Electricity and Gas Fraud jupyter notebook, there are 8 sections, namely 
- 1) Data Cleaning
- 2) Graph supporting feature selection
- 3) Undersampling & splitting Data
- 4) Machine Learning Models
- 5) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- 6) Stepwise Regression
- 7) Hyperparameter Importance Analysis
- 8) Overall Comparison

To run any section 2-8, section 1 must have been run beforehand. Section 2 just provides some ideas of our dataset using graph. All sections 4-7 include the respective result of the model.

Read through the description paragraph before each cell. Some cells are optional and would take very long to run. We have marked those cells with [optional] and #optional. The rest of the cells must be run in the exact sequence. Please ignore any warning messages. The longest time for each cell to run is 18mins at max (only one cell).

Note: some of the packages may be require to download beforehand. Section 2 may take over an hour to run due to huge dataset and it is not necessary to run. Don't forget to download the TWO dataset, client.csv and invoice.csv also!
